### Hi, I'm Logan! Thanks for checking out my profile. You can learn more about me here.

I'm currently working on learning how to code using the Python language and completing my first few beginner's projects to start developing my skills.
I'm focused mainly on learning the concepts of Computer Science at this time, and learning to code in the Python programming language.
I would love to collaborate with anyone that has a relatively simple Python project that they would like some extra hands for.
I would like to get some help on figuring out a good roapmap to take on my journey to entering the field of full-stack software development.
Ask me about my problem-solving skills, they are very creative and effective.
You can reach me if you'd like to using my email address, loganmonday2550@gmail.com, or you can call my mobile number, which is +1(419)609-8657, at anytime that is convenient for you, and I will try to repond as quickly as possible to your inquiry. I check all of my inboxes everyday, so I am very responsive to incoming messages consistently.
My pronouns are it, they, or them.
Some interesting facts me are I can play 5 instruments, I am passionate about personal development and productivity, and I love trap metal music, such as Ghostemane, Lil Darkie, and Freddie Dread.
